Local connection
You can connect you laptop directly to the gateway via the LOCAL port.

If you have an DHCP server: Start an ssh client on port 22 and use the gateway’s IP address obtained from the DHCP server.
You don’t have a DHCP server: Configure your PC Ethernet card to use 192.168.1.100 (netmask: 255.255.255.0) and start a ssh client on port 22 and using the gateway default LOCAL IP address which is 192.168.1.1.
